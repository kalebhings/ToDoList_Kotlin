# Overview

I made this app to further my programming skills by creating a to do list application in Android. I chose to use Kotlin to further my Kotlin programming skills. 

This app is a to-do-list app. It has a field to add an item with text input, and this is where you input what you want to add to the to do list. You then can hit the add button, and it will add it to the list. If you want to delete just one specific item, you will tap the item on the list, it will check the box, and then you hit delete and it will delete the item form the list. If you want to clear the entire list altogether and start over, you can hit the clear button and it clears the list view.
